## Project description
This project looked at which local area characteristics are associated with the prevalence of obese or overweight year 6 children. It used data at the upper tier local authority level to look at the association between childhood obesity and local area factors using linear regression models. 

* The final report can be found [here](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/childhood-obesity-is-where-you-live-important)
* The code is available in [`r/`](https://github.com/NuffieldTrust/lala-obesity-year6/tree/main/r)
