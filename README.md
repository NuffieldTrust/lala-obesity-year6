# Childhood obesity: is where you live important?

<b>lala-obesity-year6: Local area linked analysis of obese and overweight year 6 children</b>

<b>Project status: complete</b>

## Project description
This project looked at which local area characteristics are associated with the prevalence of obese or overweight year 6 children. It used data at the upper tier local authority level to look at the association between childhood obesity and local area factors using linear regression models. 

* The final report can be found [here](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/childhood-obesity-is-where-you-live-important)
* The code is available in [`r/`](https://github.com/NuffieldTrust/lala-obesity-year6/tree/main/r)

## Data sources

The childhood obesity data was sourced from the [National Child Measurement Programme](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme).
The local area characteristics were sourced from a variety of different places including governement websites, see the [technical annex](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/childhood-obesity-is-where-you-live-important) for details. 
The map shapefile was sourced from [ONS Geoportal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/maps/counties-and-unitary-authorities-december-2017-ew-bfe).

<i>NOTE: For some local area characteristics the Hospital Episode Statistics (© NHS Digital 2022) were used.</i>
